# problem 1
Compare dictionaries without 'using recursions'

```
def dict_compare(*args): 
return True/False

```
 Using recursion, return a list of all combinations of dictionaries that are identical to each other for all combinations of dictionaries provided.



# problem 2
Lexicographic Permutations of 0,1,2 
solving this without knowing the technic


012</br>
021</br>
102</br>
120</br>
201</br>
210</br>
Part A :
What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

Part B :  Generalize the solution in Part A to identify the nth lexicographic permutation of a list of numbers and letters.

The list of numbers and letters may be defined as

```
solver("0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")

return the millionnt lexicographic permutation
```


# Problem 3
Counting Sundays

counting sundays from p year to q year

```
solver(from: datetime.date, to: datetime.date)
return count

```


# Problem 4
Pyramid problem find the maximum total 

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23 

```
input : solver(pyramid)
output : max of the numbers in the pyramid
```


# Problem 5

Starting in the top left corner of a  2x2
 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 
 routes to the bottom right corner.

 ```
 input : solver(nXm) :
output : number of paths 
 ```
# Problem 6
Largest Product in a Grid
What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the  grid?

```
def solver(p,q) :
  return greatest product of n
```


# Problem 7 
 Os operations 

 Advance operations related to the Os
 ```
 def solver() :
      'creating this particular file in this particular locations '

 ```

# Problem 8 
Eight Queen problem 

given is a chess board and we have to find the perfect way to add eigth queens such that they will not kill each other , 

# Problem 9 
Using list/dictionary

Find the difference or intersection / union between the strings


```
def solver(string): 
    return difference or intersection / union in string 

```


# Problem 10 
Cataloging a list of lists using recursion

takes a deeply nested list of lists and flattens it out, ignores any dict elements, and returns a dictionary where the key is value and the value is the count of each item in the flattened list. Use recursion to flatten the list.

```
def solver(list)
 return a flatten list 

```
