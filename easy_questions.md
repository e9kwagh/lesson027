**Questions which  were hard but now looks easy**

# Questions 1

One classic method for composing secret messages is called a square code. The spaces are removed from the english text and the characters are written into a square (or rectangle). For example, the sentence "If man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots" is 54 characters long, so it is written into a rectangle with 7 rows and 8 columns.

ifmanwas <br>
meanttos<br>
tayonthe<br>
groundgo<br>
dwouldha<br>
vegivenu<br>
sroots<br>


```
def my_secret(message): 
return secret_message 
```



# Questions 2

Left Outer Join

Given two files, write a left outer join function on any number of keys
```
def files_leftouterjoin(filename1, filename2,**kwargs)

 ```



The output file should be named 'results.csv' and should contain the results of the join operation

# Questions 3 
Right Outer Join

Given two files, write a right outer join function on any number of keys


``` 
files_leftouterjoin(filename1, filename2, **kwargs)
```

The output file should be named 'results.csv' and should contain the results of the join operation


# Questions 4 
 fetching data from site and  finding the required urls or needed things using only requests

 ```

 ouput : list(of urls )

 ```

 # Questions 5

 If the numbers 
 to 
 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are  1+2+3+4+5

```
# Questions 6
Infix Postfix Prefix 

```
def prefix(string) :
converting the string or given content into postfix,prefix

# Question 7 
problems of list comprihensions like :

Write a function nested_prime() to generate a list of prime numbers upto n using only a nested list comprehension

```
def solver() :
    'find the prime no in one line' 
    return list( list of prime no)
```

# Question 8 

Find the largest prime factors till that no :

using the shortcut technic, by finding square root of that number and using it to find the the factors

```
def solver(a= "start value" , b = "end value")
    return largest prime factors
 
```


#  Question 9
